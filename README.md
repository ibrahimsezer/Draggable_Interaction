- When the project runs, you can create it on the screen by selecting the item you want from the menu on the left side of the screen.
- Afterwards, you can move the items on the screen by dragging them.
- You can update the item size by pulling from the bottom right corner of each item.
- You can zoom in and out on the screen with two fingers.
- For now, the left and top screen edges are limited. (I aim to increase the screen size in the future.)
